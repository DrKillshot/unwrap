## Why Unwrap?
Unwrap was created to lower the entry barrier to functional programming in TypeScript. While object-oriented programming (OOP) requires grasping complex concepts like encapsulation, inheritance, and design patterns, functional programming can be even more challenging due to its reliance on abstract concepts such as monads, functors, groups, algebraic data types, and many more. 

Libraries like [fp-ts](https://gcanti.github.io/fp-ts/) provide powerful tools, but their mathematical terminology can make them inaccessible to beginners. Unwrap simplifies functional programming by introducing monads with semantic sugar, making it easier for developers to start using these techniques without getting lost in difficult jargon.

## Installation

To start using Unwrap, you can install it via npm or yarn. In your console:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="npm" label="npm" default>
    ```sh edit title="Npm installation"
    npm install @unnullable/unwrap
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="yarn" label="yarn">
    ```sh edit title="Yarn installation"
    yarn add @unnullable/unwrap
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="pnpm" label="pnpm">
    ```sh edit title="Pnpm installation"
    pnpm add @unnullable/unwrap
    ```  
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
